User Manual for Competency and Assessment Management System
Introduction
Welcome to the Competency and Assessment Management System! This simple, text-based system helps you manage competencies, assessments, and results for employees within your organization. The system allows managers to handle users, competencies, and assessment results, while employees (users) can have their competencies assessed and tracked.

Assessment Results: Records the results of assessments for each user.
Database File: A file named dp_customers.db is created in the program directory. Ensure the file is accessible and has appropriate permissions.
